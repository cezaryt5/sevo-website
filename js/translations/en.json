    "market_title": "From Pavements to Permanence: Securing Nyala's Marketplace",
    "market_problem_title": "The Problem: A Life on the Edge",
    "market_problem_p1": "For the women of Nyala's local markets (Al-Souq Al-Sha'abi), business used to be a gamble, not an investment. Trading \"on the ground\" meant more than just physical discomfort; it meant operating in a legal gray area.",
    "market_problem_p2": "Without official stalls or permits, these women faced a constant cycle of instability:",
    "market_problem_li1": "<strong>Asset Seizure:</strong> Inventory was frequently confiscated during municipal sweeps.",
    "market_problem_li2": "<strong>Legal Fines:</strong> Operating in the streets led to recurring fines that swallowed daily profits.",
    "market_problem_li3": "<strong>Exposure:</strong> No shelter meant being at the mercy of the weather, which often damaged perishable goods.",
    "market_solution_title": "The Solution: Designing Legitimacy",
    "market_solution_p1": "The \"Protection and Empowerment of Women and Youth in Markets\" project wasn't just about providing furniture; it was about providing a legal shield. Through a strategic partnership between the Women's Professional Association, Omdurman National Bank, the Youth Microfinance Foundation, and the Nyala Municipality, a radical shift was implemented.",
    "market_solution_p2": "The initiative focused on three pillars:",
    "market_solution_li1": "<strong>Physical Infrastructure:</strong> We designed and manufactured fixed metal kiosks (as seen in the images). These aren't just stalls; they are designated \"official workplaces\" that provide dignity and weather protection.",
    "market_solution_li2": "<strong>Legal Recognition:</strong> By moving into these kiosks, women shifted from \"illegal street vendors\" to \"authorized traders.\" This status protects them from harassment and arbitrary fines.",
    "market_solution_li3": "<strong>Financial Fuel:</strong> Real growth requires capital. Beyond the stalls, participants were integrated into microfinance programs, allowing them to expand their inventory and increase their daily turnover.",
    "market_impact_title": "The Impact: Stability is the New Foundation",
    "market_impact_p1": "Today, the market looks different. The green kiosks represent more than just a place to sell fruit or crafts—they represent a permanent stake in the local economy.",
    "market_impact_p2": "By solving the \"root cause\"—the lack of a fixed, legal location—we haven't just helped these women survive another day; we've built a framework where they can finally plan for the future.",
    "training_title": "The 2012 Genesis: Stitching a Social Fabric",
    "training_intro": "Before the kiosks and the large-scale market projects, there was an experiment in radical coexistence. In 2012, we launched a pilot program that proved economic empowerment is the most effective tool for peace-building.",
    "training_blueprint_title": "The 30-Woman Blueprint",
    "training_blueprint_p1": "We didn't just pick 30 trainees; we curated a micro-society. We brought together:",
    "training_blueprint_li1": "10 women from Dorkti (El Geneina, West Darfur)",
    "training_blueprint_li2": "10 women from Al Salam Refugee Camp",
    "training_blueprint_li3": "10 women from Nyala",
    "training_blueprint_p2": "The goal was simple but profound: Tighten the social ties. By placing women from different backgrounds and displacement statuses in the same room, we gave them a rare chance to share lived experiences, exchange skills, and realize that their struggles—and their aspirations—were identical.",
    "training_scale_title": "From Skill to Scale",
    "training_scale_p1": "Under the guidance of UN-Habitat and UNHCR, these women mastered the art of tailoring, specializing in traditional Sudanese thobes and various garments. But we knew that a skill without a tool is just a hobby.",
    "training_scale_p2": "To ensure this wasn't just another short-lived workshop, we secured direct investment from local banks. Upon graduation:",
    "training_scale_li1": "<strong>Asset Ownership:</strong> Every single woman was equipped with her own professional sewing machine.",
    "training_scale_li2": "<strong>Business Autonomy:</strong> They didn't leave as employees; they left as business owners with the capital to start their own workshops.",
    "training_legacy_title": "The Legacy",
    "training_legacy_p1": "This 2012 cohort was the \"proof of concept\" for SEVO's current model. It proved that when you give a woman a machine, you don't just feed a family—you stabilize a community. These 30 women became the ambassadors of a new, integrated Darfur, proving that the needle and thread could mend more than just cloth; they could mend a social fabric torn by conflict."
